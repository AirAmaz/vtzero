#
#  Disabled checks:
#
#  cert-dcl21-cpp
#    It is unclear whether this is still a good recommendation in modern C++.
#
#  cert-err60-cpp
#    Reports std::runtime_error as broken which we can't do anything about.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic
#    This is a low-level library, it needs to do pointer arithmetic.
#
#  google-runtime-references
#    This is just a matter of preference, and we can't change the interfaces
#    now anyways.
#
#  readability-avoid-const-params-in-decls
#    Inconsistently complaines about some cases but not others. It is nice
#    to have const in parameters if we don't change them just like with any
#    other variables.
